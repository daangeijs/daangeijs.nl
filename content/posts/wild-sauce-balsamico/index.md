This sauce is one of my personal all-time favorites and a true secret treasure in our family's recipe collection .If you would give me a plate with only this sauce, I will be a happy man. Seriously, I can drink liters of this stuff. This sauce is the perfect balance of sweet and savory, with the balsamic vinegar and sugar providing a touch of sweetness, and the wild stock giving it a rich, deep flavor. The heavy cream adds a creaminess and gives the sauce the darkbrown chocolate color and that brings it all together.
### Ingredients:

-   100 ml red balsamic vinegar
-   2 tablespoons crystal sugar
-   500 ml wild stock
-   250 ml heavy cream

### Instructions:

1.  In a steel pan, combine the balsamic vinegar and sugar. Cook over medium heat until the mixture thickens and becomes syrupy. Stir constantly to prevent burning.
2.  Remove from heat and add the wild stock, stirring until well combined.
3.  Return the pan to the heat and reduce the mixture by 1/3. The sauce will continue to thicken.
4.  Add the heavy cream and reduce again by 1/2.
5.  Serve the sauce with your favorite red meat dish and enjoy!
