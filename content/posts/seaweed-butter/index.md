Seaweed butter, or in this case "nori butter",   is a simple and easy spread that I love to eat on a freshly baked sour-dough bread, but you can also use it as a cooking ingredient. Made with a few simple ingredients, this recipe is easy to make and can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or in the freezer for up to 3 months. I recommend making a large batch of finely chopped dried nori, as it's great to have on hand for other dishes such as ramen. When I say finely chopped, I mean that you want to get it as fine as possible, ideally a powder. However, I was not able to achieve this. I chopped it first with a knife as finely as possible and then put it in my kitchen machine at full speed.
### Ingredients

-   100 grams of unsalted butter
-   2 tablespoons of finely chopped dried nori seaweed sheets
-   1 tablespoon of furikake
-   1 teaspoon (2 grams) of Maldon sea salt

### Instructions

1.  Soften the butter by leaving it out at room temperature for a few minutes or by microwaving it in short increments.
2.  In a mixing bowl, combine the butter, chopped nori seaweed, furikake, and Maldon sea salt. I use my KitchenAid for this, but you could do it even by hand if you prefer getting your hands dirty. Just make sure all the ingredients are evenly mixed through the butter mass. 
4.  Transfer the butter mixture to a sheet of plastic wrap or parchment paper and shape it into a log.
5.  Refrigerate the butter log for at least 1 hour, or until firm.
6.  Once firm, slice the butter log into rounds and serve as desired.
