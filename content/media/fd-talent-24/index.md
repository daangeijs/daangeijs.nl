In 2024 I was featured by Het Financieele Dagblad as one of the Netherlands' top 50 talents. The magazine's feature came with a tour of the Boijmans van Beuningen Depot and an event attended by Minister Micky Adriaansens, making it memorable. The event was not just an occasion for celebration but a melting pot of inspiration, where I had the pleasure of meeting and conversing with many remarkable individuals. 

The magazine covered my work at Radboudumc, where we're tackling healthcare challenges by developing an AI system aimed at diagnosing basal cell carcinoma. It's a project that stands at the intersection of technology and implementation in care, aimed at improving efficiency in our strained healthcare system.

I'm thankful for everyone involved in the magazine, especially Loeka Oostra, Thomas de Heide, Jeroen Bos, Mick Peet, and my mentors Geert Litjens and Avital Amir at Radboudumc. The creative team, including Arjan Benning, Polina Gladkova, and Im Fong Liu, brought our stories to life visually.
