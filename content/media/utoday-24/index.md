UToday wrote an in-depth article about me as a result of being nominated FD Talent 2024. The article covers my work at Radboudumc, where we're developing an AI system aimed at diagnosing basal cell carcinoma, and also a bit about my personal life. The article is in Dutch and you can read more about it [here](https://www.utoday.nl/spotlight/73980/als-een-dolle-stier-de-zorg-efficienter-maken).
